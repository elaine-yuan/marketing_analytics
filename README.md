2022 Q1 Marketing Report

In this Python project, I analyzed marketing data at a fictional small online seller and presented my findings to the marketing team at the end of the first quarter.

The questions I answered include:
1. What were the KPI values for the quarter?
2. Which demographic groups generated the most revenue?
3. What does our sales funnel look like going into the second quarter?
4. What was our ROI for the purchase of those leads if they cost $50K?
5. Were our email campaigns at the end of January (A) and beginning of March (B) effective? 
6. Which marketing campaign was more successful, A or B?

Tools: Excel, Python, PowerPoint
